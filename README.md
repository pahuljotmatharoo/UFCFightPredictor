# UFC Fight Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts the outcome of UFC fights based on historical fight data and fighter statistics. This project uses Python and popular machine learning libraries to analyze fight records, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

## Project Overview

The UFC Fight Predictor is designed to analyze historical fight data and predict the outcome of future UFC matchups. By processing fight statistics and applying machine learning algorithms, the project aims to deliver reliable predictions. This project is a valuable tool for both data science enthusiasts and UFC fans interested in the application of machine learning in sports analytics.

## Features

- **Predicts UFC fight outcomes** using machine learning models.
- Utilizes **scikit-learn's `HistGradientBoostingClassifier`** for classification.
- **Processes and visualizes data** on fighter statistics.
- Supports **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on UFC fights.
- Provides **model evaluation metrics** and insights.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pahuljotmatharoo/UFCFightPredictor.git
   cd UFCFightPredictor
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Streamlit App:
```bash
execute app.py by using
streamlit run app.py
```

## Model
This project utilizes the HistGradientBoostingClassifier from the scikit-learn library. The model is trained on historical fight data and leverages fight statistics to make predictions.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is assessed using common evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Data
The dataset includes UFC fight records, fighter statistics, and other relevant data. Ensure you have the necessary data files in place, or modify the data loading script to fit your dataset's structure.

## Results
The project outputs prediction results for upcoming UFC fights and provides visualizations of data and model performance metrics. Detailed insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA) are also included.
